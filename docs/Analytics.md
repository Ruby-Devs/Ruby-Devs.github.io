# FAQ
Q: Are Ruby IDs supposed to be public?
A: *YES!*  It's public when you release your project anyways. There is NO DANGER on sharing it. What are they gonna do, add clicks to your project?

Q: Are your servers protected against raids?
A: Yes. Our servers have a global rate limit of 1000 requests per second for a single IP address. We also use Cloudfare in all of our webpages, including our API.
# Intro
Analytics has a fair share of useful blocks that can be used to monitor extra stats that PenguinMod or TurboWarp won't give you.
These are:
- total project runs (flag clicks)
- total project stops (stop sign clicks)
- total clicks inside project
- total keys pressed inside project
Every stat mentioned can be monitored through our website.

# How do I even use it though?
You need to go [make a new Ruby ID in this page](https://rubyteam.tech/analytics/newid).
After making an ID, copy it to your clipboard, and insert it into the "set analytics ID to (ruby id)" block.

After running that block, you can individually select what stats you wish to monitor inside your project, or just monitor all stats.

# How do I get my stats now?
You can [go to this page to see all of your stats.](https://rubyteam.tech/analytics/stats).
Enter the Ruby ID you made for your project and there you go! All of your stats in one place, online.

An additional stat, which is an approximate percentage of how successful your project is, from 0-100%, is provided.
**This stat can be very, very wrong sometimes**, so don't take it as seriously as the other stats.
